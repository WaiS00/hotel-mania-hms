# Hotel Mania, An All-in-One Hotel Management System 
## Capstone Project (Chin Wai Siong 18124313)

The name Hotel Mania has a deep meaning as “mania” has a meaning of an excessive enthusiasm towards a certain topic/ object and in this case, it’s the enthusiasm towards the hotel itself. Hotel Mania is an all-in-one hotel management system that provides services to three users which are the managers, customers, and the hotel’s workers. This is because the system includes a hotel management system and a hotel booking system. The hotel management system is a feature that will be used by the managers to manage the hotel workers and the daily routine of the hotel’s operation such as the check-in, and check-out process. Besides that, the system also aims to provide a platform for customers to be able to book their rooms through the online platform which is an additional feature of the hotel management system, and the managers will be able to see the bookings that are done by the customers in order to check them into their respective rooms. Through the bookings for the customer side on the hotel booking system, the customers will also be able to make payments on their bookings and get their receipt through the system which will reduce unnecessary interactions for the customers with the workers. The goal of Hotel Mania is to develop a user-friendly web-based hotel management system for the hotel industry and fulfilling a client's request efficiently and effectively.
