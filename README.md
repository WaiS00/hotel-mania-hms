# Hotel Mania, An All-in-One Hotel Management System 
## Capstone Project (Chin Wai Siong 19124313)

Hotel management failures are the inability to provide a service that is expected from the customer, and it is also known as service failure in a hospitality faculty. Hotel management failures can cause customers’ satisfaction to drop significantly, and they will think that their desired experience is being cheated and will be having bad feedback from the hospitality faculty [2]. 

The name Hotel Mania has a deep meaning behind naming as mania has a meaning of an excessive enthusiasm towards a certain topic/ object and in this case, it’s the enthusiasm towards the hotel itself. This can encourage the workers in the hotel to perform at their very best and will need to have the amount of enthusiasm that can impress and leave meaningful positive feedback towards the customers and their satisfaction.
